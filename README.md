# eAthena Syntax README

eAthena syntax plugin for VS Code. Supports NPC scripts and CSV DB files. 

Usage:

1. Clone this repo
2. Copy the folder you cloned (eAthena-VSCode-Syntax) into %userprofile%/.vscode/extensions
3. Open VSCode settings and setup paths for extension.
4. Re-open VSCode, so the extension will sync with your Athena (you will see the message in the bottom-right corner).
5. Re-open VSCode again to load synchronized settings.
4. Open any script file and change syntax to eAthena.
